Looking at the test, I think that questions 1, 2, 3, and 4a were very much within what can be expected of most of you, while 4b, 5, and 6 were (to different degrees) more challenging.  Reading over a number of papers, I judged that a decent point for a passing mark is 20 (actually, I thought 21 should be the passing mark, but I like nice numbers), while an 80% would be at 35 marks.  The former represented the point where a student was able to show the ability to get through the raw calculations required in this course, but had very little grasp of the higher concepts, while the latter demonstrated a mastery of almost all of the mechanics and the beginning of a higher understanding.  The top grade in the class was 58, so the adjustment for a raw mark of R is.
